Our team decided to develop an AR application for cyclists to navigate to waypoints using a combination of
binaural, peripheral audio and visual representations of the waypoints in their field of view using AR glasses.
We decided to focus on all-wheeled personal transit devices as our solution can be worn and used without the
need for any mounting points, such as a bike frame. It was decided to design the application for smartphones as
they are portable, widely used, and powerful enough to run AR applications. Our app aims to improve the riderâ€™s
experience by providing a more intuitive and safer way of navigating through audio and visual cues. The user
can keep their focus on the road while receiving audio cues and visual representations of the waypoints in their
field of view.
The app will use the camera of the AR glasses and the GPS of the smartphone to overlay the waypoints onto
the real world, making it easy for the user to navigate. The audio cues will be delivered through a combination of
binaural and peripheral sound, which will provide an immersive experience and allow users to remain aware of
their surroundings.
One of the challenges of our chosen usage context is potential distraction caused by both visual and auditory
feedback. The visual cues could occlude nearby pedestrians or cars, whilst the auditory cues could prevent the
user from hearing oncoming vehicles.
Our potential users are wheeled users who need to navigate to specific destinations safely. They want an
application that is as easy or easier to use than conventional apps whilst not distracting them from their
surroundings by making them look away from the road.
The novel selling points of our interaction ideas are the combination of binaural, peripheral audio and visual
representations of the waypoints in their field of view, which we believe will complement each other and provide
an immersive and intuitive navigation experience.
We chose this approach because it provides an immersive and interactive experience while remaining safe for
the user. The combination of audio and visual cues allows the user to remain aware of their surroundings and
the app is easy to use. We also considered other solutions, such as overlaying the path of the rider on top of the
real-world road but discarded this idea as it lacks novelty while at the same time being non-trivial to implement.
In contrast, our chosen solution provides a more novel and easily-implementable input, which explores old
techniques under new contexts. Overall, our solution offers a unique and innovative way of navigating cyclists,
which we believe will improve their experience and safety on the road
