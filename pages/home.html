We're all drifting through space on this journey called life.

Personally, I find a good way to spend it is to be exploring its seemingly boundless complexity through science and engineering, solving interesting problems and meeting interesting people along the way.

<p>Recently, I've been really captivated by biology and artificial intelligence and you'll likely find a few posts relating to those topics.</p>

Being nearly finished with my Master's degree in Electronics and Software Engineering, I'm looking to get involved with businesses to help them reap the benefits of technology. 
So if you're a company, or know a company, that would want to look into how you can benefit from technology, then please feel free to contact me.

Until then, please take your time, relax and enjoy my content at your leisure.
