# Brief

Personally, I find a good way to spend life is to be exploring its seemingly boundless complexity through science and engineering, solving interesting problems and meeting interesting people along the way.

Being nearly finished with my Master's degree in Electronics and Software Engineering, I'm looking at the horizon of the future to see what's coming. Things are going to change, and change <b style="color:yellow;">rapidly</b>, so I'm looking to prepare and adapt not just me, but everyone around. 

With that being said I'm always happy to have a talk, formal or not, about the state of things. You can find my contact details in the [Contact](#contact) section.

## Hobbies

- **Photography**: I recently bought a mirrorless DSLR camera and when I go hunting with it, it completely changes how I perceive the world; always looking for the next shot. I'll be posting a few pictures here and, in fact, the picture of the University above was taken with it. 

- **Camping**: Been camping since I was around 7 years old, much of it in the mountains of South of France. The main enjoyment I get from it is a sense of being grounded as I become more aware of the "real" world, which can be a brutal, unforgiving place if you're not prepared.

- **Guitar/Piano**: Since beginning University, I started exploring the roads and avenues of music through instruments too. Actively participating in the creation of music brings about a much more personal experience, as you become much more self-conscious when listening.
