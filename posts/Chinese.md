# Introduction
One of my sparetime activities is to learn Chinese, or more precisely mandarin. 

As an engineer, I've spent a lot of my time working with protocols, fault tolerance and the relationship between baud rate (transmitted symbols) and bit rate (transmitted information). 
So I find it quite fun and intriguing to realise that there are all these parallels between humans and communications systems. 

With that said, the purpose of this post is for myself to learn Chinese whilst also commenting on the language itself. 

# Resources
I found this video called [Learn Chinese for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQOUSJOVHp8) really useful in learning Chinese. The reason is that it is conversation-based, words are repeated by the narrator and they let you hear the pronounciation of both young, middle-aged and old people for a nice and varied sample. Furthermore, they include the spelling in both latin characters and hieroglyphs.

# Nouns

## Singular
| English | Chinese |
| --- | --- |
| I/Me | Wo |
| You | Ni |
| He/She | Ta |

## Plural
To pluralise, the rule is simply to add a 'men' afterwards:

| English | Chinese |
| --- | --- |
| We/Us | Wo men |
| You | Ni men |
| They/Them | Ta men |

# Possession

## Singular
To add possession, simply add a 'de' afterwards:

| English | Chinese |
| --- | --- |
| My | Wo de |
| Your | Ni de |
| His/Her | Ta de |

## Plural
And, brilliantly, you can chain together the plural and possession:

| English | Chinese |
| --- | --- |
| Our | Wo men de |
| Your | Ni men de |
| Their | Ta men de |

# To be

To say 'am', as in 'to be', you would say 'shi'.
Contrary to English, there is no conjugation, so one simply adds it to the the end of a noun:

| English | Chinese |
| --- | --- |
| I am | Wo shi |
| You are | Ni shi |
| He/She is | Ta shi |

# Negation 

To negate, you add 'bu' before the thing you want to negate

So you could say 'I am not' by saying 'wo bu shi', literally meaning 'I not am'.

This is the same as is used in many conventional programming language

Python:
```Python
if(not True)
```

C++:
```C++
if(! true)
```

# Adjectives 

## Countries

To say a certain country, you combine certain words with 'guo', meaning country.
For America, this is 'mei guo' meaning 'beautiful country'.

Here's a list of a few countries:

| English | Chinese | 
| --- | --- |
| England | Ying guo | 
| France | Fa guo | 
| China | Jong guo | 
| America | Mei guo | 
| Germany | De guo |

The chinese way of saying that you're of a certain country is literally to combine the country and 'person'.
The chinese word for person is 'ren'. 

So 'I am french' becomes: 'Wo shi fa guo ren', literally meaning 'I am france country person' 
'You are american' becomes: 'Ni shi ying guo ren', literally meaning 'You are beautiful country person'
and so on. 

# Question

To turn a statement into a question, all you need to do is chain on the word 'ma' at the end. 

So 'are you french?' becomes 'Ni shi fa guo ren ma', literally meaning 'you are france person?'

# Verbs

| English | Chinese |
| --- | --- |
| do | zuo |
| am | shi |
| am called | jiao |
